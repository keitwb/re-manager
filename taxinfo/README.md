Tax Information
---------------

This is a service that scraps real estate property tax information from county
websites and returns them in a standardized format.  Counties in NC generally
have old sites with no (or non-public) API access so it must generally be
gotten through scraping HTML websites.  Each county must have its own
implementation here.
