# Update Streamer

This streams updates from Mongo to a websocket connection.  It is useful for maintaining state of
the webapp based on changes both from other users as well as from the active user that is watching
with the websocket.

It is written for Python 3.6+ and is entirely stateless, so it can be run as many times as needed.

## Development

See [Python](../README.md#python).
